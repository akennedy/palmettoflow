# Palmetto Flow

Palmetto Flow is a concept about building applications.  Palmetto is a set of principals that enable you to implement in technologies of your choice.  The goal is to create applications, components and services that act like stereos, it is very easy to replace pieces of the application without having to replace/re-write the entire application.  There are a few concepts to understand and they should be straight forward and simple to follow:

* [Application State](state.md)
* [Write Stream](stream.md)
* [Events](events.md)
* [Components](components.md)
* [Services](services.md)

## Features

### Easy to understand

By structuring the application into components and services, it should be easy for developers to understand and work together on features of the application.  It should be straight forward where code should live on a component or service.

### Re-Usability

Componenents can be built into component trees and be reused in several different applications, especially if you follow a pattern of seperating your pure components from your state components, this will increase the re-usability of your components.
